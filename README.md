# Enrol by student number

Moodle plugin for http://skos.ii.uni.wroc.pl/ (Moodle of http://ii.uni.wroc.pl/ ) by Michalis Kamburelis.

Based on https://github.com/ndunand/moodle-enrol_attributes by Nicolas Dunand (thousand thanks!). Changed to use studentnumber (which is stored in username (currently) on our Moodle), this makes the plugin simpler (no custom fields, no complicated rules editing, no Shibboleth).
